# FuzeFront app self-registration — run as a Kubernetes INIT CONTAINER.
#
# Registers the app with the FuzeFront platform at pod startup: app registry entry,
# AuthZ (Permit) policy, and billing profile. Idempotent — safe to run on every pod
# start, every restart, and concurrently across replicas.
#
# WHY THIS IS AN INIT CONTAINER AND NOT A BEST-EFFORT SIDECAR:
# the app depends on FuzeFront for AuthN, AuthZ, org/user context, and billing. An
# unregistered app cannot function correctly, so a registration failure MUST stop the
# pod — it exits non-zero and the pod CrashLoopBackOffs until the problem is fixed.
# Failing loudly at deploy beats a half-registered app serving traffic.
#
# Required env:
#   FUZEFRONT_API_URL             base URL, e.g. http://fuzefront-applications:3003
#   FUZEFRONT_REGISTRATION_TOKEN  bearer token for a service account with apps:register
# Optional env:
#   REGISTRATION_DIR   directory holding manifest.json (default: /registration)
#   SKIP_ACTIVATE      "true" to register but not activate (staged rollout)
#
# Exit codes: 0 = registered/activated (or already was). 1 = anything else.

# registry row, because `roles`, `visibility`, `integration` and `nav` are per-surface
# and one row cannot hold five of each. Before this, such a repo could only register
# one of them and the rest silently vanished from the portal.
#
# manifest.json stays the PRIMARY surface and keeps owning the product-level
# attachments (policy, billing) — those are per-product, not per-surface, so binding
# them to a fixed slug removes any ambiguity about which sibling they belong to.
# Additional surfaces go in apps/ and are registered identically. They group in the
# menu by declaring the same nav.suite.id.
