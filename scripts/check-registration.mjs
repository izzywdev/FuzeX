/**
 * Guards FuzeFront registration end to end. Zero dependencies — runs on a bare
 * `actions/setup-node` with no install step.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-registration.mjs
 *
 * Four checks, for the four ways this silently breaks:
 *
 * 1. `registration/manifest.json`'s `nav.section` is a real NavSection. This is a
 *    production-incident-derived guard: FuzeFinance once shipped `nav.section:
 *    "business"` — a perfectly plausible name that is not in the enum — and every
 *    existing gate passed it, because `@fuzefront/onboarding-kit`'s
 *    validate-registration.mjs is an opt-in npm-installed fleet-policy checker, not
 *    something every repo runs, and nothing dependency-free re-validated the shape.
 *    The platform parses the manifest with `registerAppRequestSchema.safeParse`
 *    (FuzeFront `backend/applications/src/app-registry/manifest.schema.ts`), whose
 *    `nav.section` is `z.enum(NAV_SECTIONS)` — an unknown section fails the parse,
 *    `POST /apps` answers 400, and register.sh treats any non-201/409 as fatal, so
 *    the pod CrashLoopBackOffs and the product never appears in the portal. That is
 *    a symptom nobody reads as "bad nav.section" — it reads as "the app is broken".
 *
 * 2. `registration/policy.json` is VALID against FuzeFront's frozen ProductPolicy
 *    contract. An invalid policy is rejected with a 400 inside an init container at
 *    deploy time — an error in a pod log nobody tails. A policy that is *accepted*
 *    but whose role names an action the document never declares is worse: nothing
 *    errors anywhere, Permit creates the role, and it grants nothing. The symptom is
 *    "our users have no permissions", which reads as a bug in this app.
 *
 * 3. The registration ConfigMap actually SHIPS that policy, byte-equivalent. The
 *    ConfigMap inlines its own copies of the registration files, so the file in this
 *    repo is decorative unless the ConfigMap carries it — which is exactly how this
 *    app ended up with a committed, correct policy.json that no deploy ever sent.
 *
 * 4. The DISPLAY NAME does not carry the `Fuze` prefix. Cosmetic on its own; the
 *    reason it is a gate is that the rule it replaces was ENFORCED BACKWARDS. Four
 *    repos shipped a repo-local check that rejected a `fuze`-prefixed SLUG and told
 *    the author to migrate — and because `slug` is immutable, "migrate" means
 *    register-a-second-app-then-delete-the-first, which orphans the product's Permit
 *    grants and CASCADE-deletes its app_installations rows. A gate that pushes people
 *    toward an irreversible migration is worse than no gate. Owner ruling 2026-08-19:
 *    the prefix STAYS on the slug and comes OFF the display string. See §4 below.
 *
 * Mirrors bin/validate-policy.mjs in @fuzefront/onboarding-kit. Keep in step with it.
 *
 * History: this file used to check ONLY #2 and #3. Several repos (FuzeExecutive,
 * FuzeBI, among others) had their OWN repo-local check-registration.mjs that also
 * caught #1 — written after the FuzeFinance CrashLoopBackOff above. The installer's
 * `--adopt-canonical` replaced those repo-local scripts with this one, silently
 * dropping #1 from every repo that received it, while gate-registration.yml kept
 * calling this script and kept claiming the nav.section guarantee in its header —
 * green, and enforcing nothing. #1 is restored here, in the canonical, so the whole
 * fleet gets it back in one place instead of forking it again per repo.

// NAMING CONVENTION, corrected 2026-08-19 by owner ruling:
//
//     slug: "fuzeservice"    name: "Service"    menuLabel: "Service"
//
// The prefix STAYS on the slug and comes OFF the display string. The convention was
// never about the URL — it was that a launcher listing fifteen products all beginning
// "Fuze" is unreadable, which is a property of the RENDERED LABEL. The slug keeps the
// prefix where it does useful work: unambiguous in a Permit key (`<slug>_<Resource>`),
// a billing product key, and an `/app/<slug>` path, in a family where `deploy`,
// `market` and `call` are generic enough to collide with something else one day.
//
// THE SLUG IS DELIBERATELY NOT CHECKED, IN EITHER DIRECTION, and that is the whole
// point of adding this here. FuzeDeploy, FuzeCall, FuzeExecutive and FuzeFinance each
// carried a repo-local rule that REJECTED a prefixed slug. `slug` is immutable — the
// contract has no rename — so the only way to act on that error is to register a
// second app and delete the first, orphaning Permit grants and CASCADE-deleting
// app_installations rows. Failing a build over a value nobody can safely change does
// not prevent the mistake; it pressures someone into a destructive migration.
//
// The field is also already split across the fleet, and all of it is live. Measured on
// default branches 2026-08-19: `fuzex` and `fuzebi` carry the prefix; `deploy`, `call`,
// `executive`, `finance`, `keys`, `market` and `picker` do not. None are to be
// migrated. An error in EITHER direction reds a real repo with no safe remedy.
//
// `name` and `menuLabel` are the opposite case in every respect: mutable, re-sent by
// register.sh on every pod start, fixed with a one-line edit and no registry surgery.
// BOTH are checked, not just `name` — FuzeBI today reads menuLabel "BI" (already
// right) with name "FuzeBI" (not), which is exactly the half-fix that checking a
// single field would bless.
//
// This lives in the CANONICAL on purpose. The four repos above were fixed in place,
// but `--adopt-canonical` overwrites a repo-local check-registration.mjs with this
// file — the same way it silently dropped the nav.section check documented above. A
// rule that exists only in the consuming repos is a rule that gets deleted by the next
// reconcile.
