"""gate-platform-auth — enforce that a service's authN/authZ is real.

Written after FuzeFinance shipped a production service with NO authentication
and NO authorization, and every existing gate passed it. That is the design
brief: each check below exists because something that should have caught this
did not.

What actually happened (FuzeFinance#28). `backend/src/server.js` wrapped its
auth setup in try/catch. The catch arm installed a mock identity with
`roles: ['admin','finance_officer']` and a `requireRoles` that called `next()`
unconditionally. `@fuzefront/auth` was never declared in package.json, so the
require ALWAYS threw and the fallback was the only path that ever ran. Every
request was an admin. The single signal was a console.warn at boot.

Why nothing caught it:
  - gate-authz ends in `|| true`, so it cannot fail a PR.
  - helm lint / kubeconform check shape, not behaviour.
  - The readiness probe passed, because the service genuinely WAS healthy —
    just unauthenticated. Health is not a security signal.
  - Nothing asserted that an unauthenticated request gets a 401.

Check families:

  --fail-open   (F, default — the FuzeFinance class)
    F1  an auth import inside try/except|catch whose fallback grants identity,
        roles, or calls next() unconditionally. Auth that degrades to
        permissive is worse than no auth: it looks guarded in review.
    F2  a middleware named like an auth guard whose body only calls next()

  --declared    (D, default)
    D1  source imports @fuzefront/auth but no manifest declares the dependency.
        This is the exact FuzeFinance defect: the import can only ever throw.
    D2  the dependency is declared but never imported anywhere — an inert
        declaration that satisfies a naive "is it installed" check while
        guarding nothing

  --secrets     (S, default)
    S1  a signing secret supplied as a string literal rather than from env
    S2  legacy-hs256 selected with no federated/JWKS path configured at all
    S3  a verifier constructed without pinned algorithms — unpinned invites
        `alg:none` and RS256-verified-as-HMAC confusion

  --authz       (Z, default)
    Z1  a repo with mutating routes and zero requirePermission/createAuthzClient
        call sites. Authentication answers WHO; without this nothing answers
        WHETHER THEY MAY.
    Z2  a DECISION_UNAVAILABLE branch that yields anything other than a denial.
        The client is fail-closed by contract and has no fail-open option;
        re-introducing one locally defeats it.
    Z3  a direct Permit SDK call from a product. Products know exactly one
        thing: the base URL of FuzeFront's Security API.

  --rate-limit  (R, default)
    R1  a repo with an HTTP API and no rate limiter mounted anywhere

  --routes      (E, default — per-route coverage, ratcheted)
    E1  a route registered with no authentication boundary at any level and no
        declaration that it is deliberately public. Every family below reasons
        about the REPO; all of them are green on a repo whose auth is real but
        whose individual route lost its guard.
    E2  route-shaped source the scanner could not read. Unreadable is not clean.
    E3  a public-route exemption for a route that is gone or is now guarded
    E4  a declaration entry with no `# reason`
    Runs as a changed-lines ratchet in CI (--changed-only): a route this diff
    declares or edits must be classified; inherited debt is counted, not blocking.

  --adoption    (A, default — the anti-vacuous check)
    A1  a repo that serves HTTP endpoints has SOME auth boundary. Every other
        family asks "is what is here correct"; all of them pass vacuously on a
        service with no auth at all, which is precisely the state that shipped.

The last one is the important one, and it is deliberately modelled on
gate_identifier's --adoption: a family standard whose gate is satisfied by
non-adoption is not a standard.

RATCHET, AND WHY IT IS OPT-OUT RATHER THAN OPT-IN.

This gate enforces by DEFAULT. A repo silences it by declaring
`platformAuth.enforce: false` in .fuze/manifest.json, and that declaration
must carry a `reason`.

The first cut had it the other way round -- enforce only where a repo opted in
-- on the reasoning that landing it hot would red most of the fleet on
pre-existing violations, which is how gate-authz acquired its `|| true`. That
reasoning is real but it solves the wrong half. Opt-in enforcement is exactly
how `gate-identifier` reached ZERO adoption across 21 repos: the standard
shipped, the gate shipped, nobody ever set the flag, and a check nobody has
enabled is indistinguishable from a check that does not exist. The `|| true`
and the never-set flag are the same failure wearing different clothes.

The difference that matters is not hot vs. cold, it is VISIBLE vs. INVISIBLE.
`|| true` buried in a workflow is unreadable and uncountable. An `enforce:
false` in a manifest is one grep away, it names the repo, and with a mandatory
`reason` it reads as debt someone wrote down rather than as a setting someone
left alone. So the escape hatch stays -- a repo mid-migration must be able to
land work -- but it costs a sentence, and that sentence is the artifact.

Consequently an opt-out with no reason is NOT an opt-out: the gate enforces
anyway and says why. Skipping enforcement is a decision, and an undocumented
decision is indistinguishable from an oversight.

Exit codes: 0 clean or report-only, 1 findings while enforcing, 2 bad usage.

# Route-level coverage. The families above all reason about the REPO: does it
# declare the package, does it import it, does any auth boundary exist at all.
# Every one of them is green on a repo whose auth is real but whose individual
# route lost its guard -- which is the FuzeAgent shape: `main.py` authenticates
# properly and `simple_main.py` published the same domain with none, so A1 saw
# an auth boundary and stopped looking. A per-repo question cannot answer a
# per-route one.
#
# CLOSED SET, NOT A DENYLIST. Every discovered route must end up in exactly one
# of three buckets: guarded (evidence found), public (declared, with a reason),
# or UNGUARDED (fails). There is no fourth "didn't recognise it, carry on"
# bucket -- that bucket is how `/applications` stayed exposed behind a path
# denylist that only knew about `/application`. A route the scanner cannot
# classify is a finding, not a shrug.
#

#   governance/public-routes.txt exempts a specific METHOD + path from needing
#                                one. An exemption, not evidence.
# Conflating them is how an allowlist quietly becomes the hole: "we couldn't
# detect the guard" and "this endpoint is deliberately open" are different
# facts and must not share a file.
